There are many dunder methods available, and they allow you to tinker in sophisticated ways with how objects interact. For example, there are dunder methods for adding, subtracting, and comparing, allowing you to use the `+`, `-`, or `>` operators with user defined classes. Typically, however, you will only use the `__init__`. So let's expand the class and give it an init method.\n"

    "So far, we have looked at how to define a class, how to instantiatie a class, and how to add state and behavior to a class. For many applications of object oriented programming in the context of agent based modeling this is adequate. However, a key reason for using object orientation is that it allows you to split your code into smaller parts that are easier to write, maintain, and expand. To do this, object oriented program uses the idea of inheritence. The basic idea is that you create a hierarcy of classes where classes lower in the hierarchy are a further specification or detailing of a class higher in the hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we have a model about civil unrest with cops and protesters. Both cops and protesters move about the space in the same way, and their vision. (i.e. what other agents they can see) works in the same way. However, a cop uses what it sees in order to make an arrest, while a protester makes a risk assessment based on what it can see to inform the choice of whether to become an active protester. In this simple example, the moving and seeing behavior is shared. Ideally, you want to implement this only once, while how this is being used for the specific behavior of the cop and protester is left to the cop and agent class. Here inheritence can be used to implement the generic behavior in a parent class (e.g. BaseAgent) and leave the cop and protester behavior to the child classes (i.e., Cop and Protester). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below a skeleton implementation of the BaseAgent, Cop, and Protester is given. First, we implement the `update_vision` and `move` methods in `BaseAgent`. Next, we create a cop class and indicate that `BaseAgent` is its parent (or super) class by stating this in between brackets: `class Cop(BaseAgent)`. Last, we can use `super()` to call a method on our parent class. So, `super().act()` on the `Cop` calls the `act` method on `BaseAgent` en likewise with both `__init__` and `act` on the `Protester`. Note how in this example, we do not have to repeat any code. The shared behavior is all available in the `BaseAgent`, while both `Cop` and `Protester` expand on this basic behavior in their own unique way.\n",
